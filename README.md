# C File Handling using System Calls ⚙️📂

This repository contains my learning and implementation of **file handling in C** using **low-level system calls**.  
It focuses on understanding how file operations are managed directly by the **Operating System**.

---

## 📍 About
- 💡 Learned how to perform file operations using **system calls** instead of standard library functions.  
- 🧠 Explored how the **kernel interacts** with files through file descriptors.  
- 🏗️ Implemented small programs demonstrating real system-level I/O handling.

---

## ⚙️ System Calls Covered
- `open()` – Open or create a file  
- `creat()` – Create a new file  
- `read()` – Read data from a file  
- `write()` – Write data to a file  
- `lseek()` – Move the file pointer  
- `close()` – Close the file descriptor

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Language: **C**  
- Compiler: **GCC**  
- OS: **Linux**

---

## 🚀 Goal
To gain a clear understanding of **low-level file handling** and **system calls**, forming a base for **system programming and OS concepts**.
